# BlueForge

BlueForge is a software planning platform built with Java and Spring Boot that helps transform early-stage product ideas into structured technical plans.

Instead of generating an entire specification from a single prompt, BlueForge follows an iterative planning workflow. It asks clarifying questions, captures missing requirements, versions every planning step, and gradually builds a more complete project specification.

The project is designed to explore backend architecture, AI integration, and production-oriented software engineering practices.

## Architecture

```
                  +----------------+
                  |     Client     |
                  +-------+--------+
                          |
                          v
                 Spring Boot REST API
                          |
                +---------+---------+
                |                   |
                v                   v
          Application Service    AI Client
                |                   |
                |             OpenRouter
                |
                v
          Spring Data JPA
                |
                v
            PostgreSQL
```

BlueForge follows a layered architecture where each layer has a single responsibility.

- Controllers expose REST endpoints.
- Services contain business logic.
- Repositories handle persistence.
- AI providers are isolated behind a common interface.
- Prompt templates are stored outside the application code.

## Workflow

```
User submits an idea
        │
        ▼
POST /api/projects
        │
        ▼
Generate clarifying questions
        │
        ▼
Persist Project + Version + Questions
        │
        ▼
Retrieve project version
```

---

## API

### Create Project

```
POST /api/projects
```

Request

```json
{
  "name": "BlueForge",
  "ideaDescription": "A platform that transforms software ideas into technical plans."
}
```

Response

```json
{
  "projectId": 1,
  "versionId": 1,
  "questions": [
    "Who are the primary users?",
    "Will authentication be required?",
    "Should multiple users collaborate on the same project?"
  ]
}
```

---

### Get Project Version

```
GET /api/projects/{projectId}/versions/{versionNumber}
```

---

## Running Locally

Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zeynep-ates/blueforge.git
cd blueforge
```

Start PostgreSQL.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Configure the required environment variables.

```text
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key
OPENROUTER_MODEL=your_model
```

Run the application.

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

---

## Testing

Run the complete test suite.

```bash
./mvnw verify
```

Current test coverage includes:

- Service layer tests
- Controller tests
- AI client tests
- Persistence verification
- Transaction rollback verification

---

## Design Decisions

Some of the architectural decisions made during development include:

- Flyway is the single source of truth for the database schema.
- Hibernate validates the schema instead of generating it.
- AI providers are isolated behind a common interface.
- Prompt templates are stored outside Java code.
- DTOs are separated from persistence entities.
- Database operations are transactional to guarantee consistency.
