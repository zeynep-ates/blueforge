# BlueForge

BlueForge is an AI-powered software planning platform built with Java, Spring Boot, and React.

Instead of generating an entire specification from a single prompt, BlueForge follows an iterative planning workflow. It asks clarifying questions, captures missing requirements, versions every planning step, and gradually transforms an idea into structured technical artifacts.

The project focuses on clean architecture, AI integration, and production-oriented software engineering practices.

---

## Features

### AI Planning Pipeline

- Create software projects from natural language descriptions
- Generate AI-powered clarifying questions
- Generate functional and non-functional requirements
- Generate epics from requirements
- Generate user stories with acceptance criteria
- Generate engineering tasks with priority and effort estimates
- Version every planning stage

### Editing

- Edit the title and description of generated Requirements, Epics, and Tasks
- Edit the title, description, and acceptance criteria of generated User Stories
- Changes save immediately via dedicated PATCH endpoints, no regeneration required

### Regeneration

- Regenerate Requirements, Epics, User Stories, or Tasks for any stage a version has already reached
- Regeneration never overwrites existing data — it creates a new project version instead, leaving the original version and any manual edits in it untouched
- Optional note describing why a stage was regenerated

### Backend

- Layered Spring Boot architecture
- Provider-independent AI abstraction
- Transaction-safe persistence
- Flyway database migrations
- Input validation
- Swagger / OpenAPI documentation
- Docker-based local development

### Frontend

- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Responsive workspace
- Hierarchical Epic → User Story → Task visualization
- Light / Dark / System theme
- Recent Projects
- Dialog-based editing of generated artifacts
- OpenAPI-generated API client
- TanStack Query

                |               OpenRouter

                ▼
        Spring Data JPA
                |
                ▼
            PostgreSQL
```

BlueForge follows a layered architecture where each layer has a single responsibility.

- Controllers expose REST endpoints.
- Services contain business logic.
- Repositories handle persistence.
- AI providers are isolated behind a common interface.
- Prompt templates are stored outside the application code.

## Design Decisions

- Flyway is the single source of truth for the database schema.
- Hibernate validates the schema instead of generating it.
- AI providers are isolated behind a common interface.
- Prompt templates are stored outside Java code.
- DTOs are separated from persistence entities.
- Database operations are transactional to guarantee consistency.
- Frontend API types are generated directly from the backend's OpenAPI specification.

Additional documentation is available in:
